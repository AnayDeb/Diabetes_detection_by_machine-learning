# Diabetes Detection Using Machine Learning (SVM)

This project predicts whether a pregnant woman is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic data. It uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification and is built using Python and machine learning libraries.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
  Trained with sklearn’s `SVC` classifier on a cleaned dataset after handling missing values.

---

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Scaling
4. Model Training (SVM)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)
